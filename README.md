# marathon_map

Marathon Map is an interactive web application that showcases local attractions
and amenities in Marathon, Florida -- the heart of the Florida Keys! By selecting
a category from the menu -- which includes restaurants, hotels, and a number of recreational
opportunities -- users immediately see up to twenty relevant locations displayed on the map. 
Clicking on a map marker or a location name reveals additional information about each individual
attraction. 

The project relies on the Google Maps API and Places Library for its basic functionality and 
content. The Knockout.js and jQuery libraries provide additional structure and streamlining.

While the current project focuses on Marathon, the application can be customized for any
city or region simply by changing the map-center coordinates in the main javascript file. 
Additionally, custom locations can be added independently of Google's API, allowing 
developers to make use of local knowledge.
